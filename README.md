## Description

During the "Wild Work Week" at the University of Toulon, I participated in a student project aimed at promoting the MMI (Multimedia and Internet Professions) training and the work done by students. In my team, composed of digital creators and communicators, I was the only developer. Our mission was to create an interactive and innovative web experience in a very limited time of only 3 days. The result of this intense collaboration is "Studer", a web application inspired by Tinder, where the goal is to "match" with the user's favorite MMI course, whether it be creation, development or communication. This playful and interactive approach highlights the various aspects and specializations of the MMI training in an engaging way.

The "Studer" application is structured around the main "cards" functionality, which presents the work of the group's students. Users can swipe the cards to the right or left to like or dislike each project. This interaction is not only playful; it also allows an invisible score to be incremented that calculates the user's preferences based on their reactions to the different projects. In addition to navigating through the projects, users can click on a card to access more details about each work. They can learn more about the project, ask questions via an integrated chatbot, and interact more deeply with the content presented.

At the end of the experience, the application reveals the compatibility results, indicating the MMI course — creation, development, or communication — that best matches the user's preferences, based on their interactions with the projects. This result is accompanied by options to contact the students responsible for the work that most interested the user, facilitating more personalized and targeted exchanges.
